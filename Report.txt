Dear, 

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App. 

2000 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 190 And Total Concurrent API requested: 12000.
2100 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 172 And Total Concurrent API requested: 12600.
2300 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 141 And Total Concurrent API requested: 13800.
2400 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 207 And Total Concurrent API requested: 14400.
2450 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 111 And Total Concurrent API requested: 14700.

While executed 2400 concurrent request, found  3 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.02%. 

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 14400 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
